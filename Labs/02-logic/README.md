## VHDL kód design
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of comparator_2bit is
begin
    B_less_A_o    <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';
    B_greater_A_o <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o  <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';


    -- WRITE "GREATER" AND "EQUALS" ASSIGNMENTS HERE


end architecture Behavioral;
